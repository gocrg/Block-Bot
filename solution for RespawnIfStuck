when using it youll notice when u stand still while its trying to detect the person again youll die and why is this happening? well theres a thing in the config called RespawnIfStuck and its automatically set true but if u set it to false u wont die simple idk why i made this but its something simple so youll know why or u can edit the StuckTimeout and js add a bigger number instead of 10 which is default
